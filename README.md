This website is using a parallax effect to achieve different scroll speeds of elements against their backgrounds.  It does this using a couple JavaScript libraries, HTML, and CSS.  There are very few actual files in this solution and images can be easily swapped by simple editing of the style.css file along with the other html files that contain all the privacy practice text.  Enjoy!
